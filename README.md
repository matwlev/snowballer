# Snowballer
A debt snowball calculator based on Dave Ramsey's debt snowballer method of paying off debt.

This project was created as my final project for the Launchcode apprenticeship program after completing Launchcode's LC101 class (javascript track).

The tools used in this project are:
- Javascript
- Bootstrap (3.3.7)
- jQuery (3.2.1)
- Google Fonts API
